Goal: Gitlab runner needs to install and configure itself start to finish from the cloud-init script. Completely without any manual actions done through SSH :)
While writing the script, testing and debugging SSH is fine, but the actual goal is to have the gitlab runner auto install and configure completely from the cloud init script
